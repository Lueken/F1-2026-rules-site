## **BASIC F1 TERMS**

* **Constructor:** The team that builds the car (Ferrari, Mercedes, Red Bull, etc.). Teams score points separately from drivers.  
* **Pole Position:** Starting first on the grid because you had the fastest qualifying lap.  
* **Pit Stop:** Pulling into the pits during the race to change tires, fix damage, or adjust the car. Takes 2-3 seconds for a tire change.  
* **Qualifying:** Saturday session where drivers compete for grid position. Fastest lap wins pole position.  
* **Grid:** The starting lineup formation. Better qualifying performance means starting closer to the front.  
* **Undercut/Overcut:** Pit strategy where you either pit earlier than your rival (undercut) or stay out longer (overcut) to gain track position.  
* **Safety Car:** Pace car deployed after crashes or debris. Field bunches up, no overtaking allowed until it leaves the track.

## **NEW 2026 TERMINOLOGY**

* **Active Aero (Z-Mode / S-Mode):** Replaces DRS. The driver now dynamically adjusts the wings between two modes:  
  1. **Z-Mode (Cornering):** High downforce for grip in corners**.**  
  2. **X-Mode (Straight):** Low drag for top speed on straights.  
* **Boost Mode:** Driver-controlled power bursts adding 470 HP instantly. Available anytime for creative attacks/defense, not just on straights. Drains battery quickly.  
* **Overtake Mode (OT):** A system "unlock" (not a button) that triggers automatically when within 1 second of the car ahead at the detection point.  
  1. **The Effect:** Raises the speed limit where electric power is throttled from 180 mph to 209 mph.  
  2. **Availability:** Lasts the entire lap once triggered. Freely available (no gap needed) during Practice and Qualifying.  
* **Recharge (4 Ways):** Drivers now harvest energy in four distinct ways:  
  1. **Braking:** Standard harvesting.  
  2. **Lifting Early:** Coasting into corners.  
  3. **Corner Overloading:** Managing throttle specifically in corners to charge.  
  4. **Super Clipping:** Harvesting while still applying 100% throttle (usually at end of straights).

## **WHAT'S DIFFERENT IN 2026**

* **Power Split:** Cars now run 50/50 electric and combustion engine power.  
* **MGU-K Upgrade:** The kinetic motor generator is massive now. Power output increased from 120kW to 350kW (\~160.9 HP to \~469.4 HP).  
* **No More MGU-H:** The heat recovery system is gone.  
* **Chassis Changes:**  
  * **Smaller:** 20cm shorter and 10cm narrower.  
  * **Lighter:** Minimum weight reduced by \~30kg.  
  * **Narrower Tires:** Front tires reduced by 25mm, rears by 30mm to reduce drag  
* **Sustainable Fuel:** First year running 100% advanced sustainable fuel.
* **Driver Cooling:** Mandatory cooling system (vest/shirt) active when ambient temp hits ~31°C (88°F).
* **Safety Lights:** New lights on rear wing endplates to signal if the car is electrically safe to touch.

## **2026 GRID CONTEXT**

* **Fresh Start:** 2026 is among the most radical regulation changes F1 has attempted  
* **New Engine Partnerships:**  
  * **Mercedes Power:** Mercedes, McLaren, Williams, Alpine  
  * **Ferrari Power:** Ferrari, Haas, Cadillac  
  * **Red Bull Ford:** Red Bull Racing, Racing Bulls  
  * **Honda:** Aston Martin  
  * **Audi:** Audi (Works team)

## **RACE DAY BASICS**

* **Formation Lap:** One slow lap before the race starts to warm up tires and brakes.  
* **Lights Out:** Race starts when five red lights go out.  
* **DRS Zones Gone:** Old system restricted passing aids to specific zones. Now, drivers manage Active Aero and Boost constantly around the whole track.  
* **Fastest Lap:** Bonus point awarded to whoever sets the fastest single lap during the race. Must finish in top 10 to claim it.

## **AUSTRALIAN GP DETAILS**

* **Lap Count:** 58 Laps  
* **Race Length:** \~1 hour 30 minutes  
* **Track Note:** High evolution track; grip improves significantly as the race goes on.
